      <h1>Anonymous Manifesto</h1>
      <p> <a href="">Open source </a>
        products evolve through a great community cooperation that includes individual developers and
        programmers as well as large companies. The license allows everybody in the community to study thoroughly,
        change the codes and use it for any purpose.
        A big challenge with the closed-source proprietary solutions is that it does not allow the users to make any
        changes to the software. In simple words you are not allowed to see how the software works or even customize it
        accordingly to fit the unique needs of your business or even optimize the performance.
        The open source software development started back to the 1980s and the Linux operating system was the first
        major open source software effort that is now a main operating system used for web hosting servers. The most
        popular web development platforms include the WordPress, Drupal, Joomla and many other CMSs that are preferred
        by most business owners.
        Some Benefits of Open Source Technologies:
        â€¢ Flexibility: The biggest benefit of open source is that it offers great flexibility to use the platform
        according to your needs. Interoperability and connectivity with the existing infrastructure or the platform is
        easier to attain and it also offers the liberty to the users to make changes to its fetures.
